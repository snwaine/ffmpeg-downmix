# ffmpeg-watch

A Docker container designed to watch a directory and encode any file automatically.

You need to set your watch and output folders either as ENVIRONMENT variables or map volumes in docker-compose:
```docker-compose 
services:
  ffmpeg-downmix:
    container_name: ffmpeg-downmix
    image: snwaine/ffmpeg-downmix
    restart: always
    environment:
      ENCODER: libx265
      CRF: 28
      PRESET: verfast
      EXTENSION: mp4
    volumes:
      - 'PATH_TO_TEMP:/temp'
      - 'PATH_TO_WATCH:/watch'
      - 'PATH_TO_OUTPUT:/output'
```
